# Welcome
In this tutorial I followed the directions outlined by [Colt Steele]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/coltsteele/) in section 198 (Optional Project: Patatap Clone) of the [The Web Developer Bootcamp]( https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview ) class.

# Why I Completed this Tutorial
With a history of backend development roles, I came to realize that to become a better engineer I needed to learn more about frontend development. To most individuals, the frontend is the product, and I was always nervous about sharing examples of my work publicly because of my limited frontend development skills. After hearing about [Brandon Morelli](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer)'s experience, I decided that it was about time I learn more about frontend development.

# Overall Impression of this Tutorial
This tutorial introduced two external libraries that I have not worked with before, Howler.js and Paper.js. Howler.js is a tool that makes triggering audio in JavaScript files easy while Paper.js is an open source vector graphics scripting framework that allows one to create impressive visual effects with minimal effort. These two tools may not be incredibly useful in the creation of an enterprise application, but provides developers with a great opportunity to get creative. Overall, I had a ton of fun creating the Patatap clone and highly recommend testing the tool out!
